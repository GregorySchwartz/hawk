-- | Use `withLock` around critical sections which cannot run in parallel with
--   other instances of hawk.
-- 
-- In the ideal case, nobody else is trying to use `withLock`.
-- 
-- >>> withLock print3
-- 1
-- 2
-- 3
-- 
-- If two instances of hawk are trying to use same resource (here stdout) at
-- the same time, problems can occur.
-- 
-- >>> print3 `par` print3'
-- 1
-- 1
-- 2
-- 2
-- 3
-- 3
-- 
-- By using `withLock`, we serialize the execution of the two critical sections.
-- 
-- >>> withLock print3 `par` withLock print3'
-- 1
-- 2
-- 3
-- 1
-- 2
-- 3
-- 
-- There is a verbose version of `withLock` which makes it easy to see when
-- two instances are trying to enter `withLock` at the same time.

-- >>> withTestLock print3

-- ** LOCKED **

-- ** UNLOCKED (hGetContents) **

-- 
-- This verbosity allows us to test a special case: a race condition in which
-- instance 1 releases the lock immediately after instance 2 notices that the
-- lock is busy, but before instance 2 begins waiting for the lock to be released.
-- 
-- We can trigger this special case with a bit of collaboration from `withTestLock`.
-- It inserts an artificial delay at the point in which we want the lock to be
-- released, and we time our instances so that instance 1 unlocks just at the right
-- moment. If we timed the experiment right, the error message should be "connect"
-- instead of "hGetContents".
